                    Situated near the West coast of India,  Pune, known by many as 'the Oxford  of the East' has been celebrated since  medieval times as a high seat of learning. Multitudes of academic institutions dot this city of over four million  even today. The focus of learning has  always been education to combine  competence with character, culture to  bring out the best in an individual and  devotion to one&apos;s duty and the  Supreme divinity that unites all living  beings.

                    In the recent past, the freedom resulting from living away from their parents, mechanistic world-view devoid of values, ethics, morals or purpose, free mixing opportunities offered by the campus environment combined to propel the students into a life of sensuality and sin. When they graduate, they carry, along with their degrees, a disdain for virtuous living, an infatuation with materialism and a host of vices unhealthy eating habits, promiscuity, smoking, alcoholism, gambling and even drug addiction.

                    Intellectual education influences the head and value-based education influences the heart. In fact, education that does not train the heart can be dangerous. If we want to build character in our offices, homes and society, we must have the wisdom to live a principle-centered life based on honesty, compassion, courage, responsibility etc. Educated persons are those who can choose wisely and courageously under any circumstances between good and bad, between virtuousness and vulgarities regardless of t

                    Peter R. Schemm in his book entitled, ‘Love: Impact on Physical and Mental Health’ explains that people who live in relationships in which they do not feel loved, protected, happy or secure are ten times more susceptible to chronic disease and five time more susceptible to mental illness. Also studies prove that love heals diseases. Community, security, protection, sharing, care and concern for one another – all these are possible only when people learn to lead a selfless life centered around the Supreme Truth. Such a life awakens the dormant love in our hearts that manifests as respect for elders, compassion for the youngers, friendliness towards equals, surrender to the laws of Almighty that matures as love for Lord and towards all living beings.

                    When the wisdom is rekindled people can discriminate between good and bad, by that surely they will be able to say NO to bad habits & yes to life and when the real love is revived people won’t search for happiness outside through alcohol, drug’s, illicit relationships and so on. So VOICE makes DRUG DE-ADDICTION a easy and a happy process because as soon a person gets a higher taste he will no longer look down to petty stupid lower tastes like drinking, smoking, drug’s.
